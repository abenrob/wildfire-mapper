## Daily Wildfire Mapper

![screenshot](screenshot.png)

This example uses Leaflet javascript mapping library to read individual locations from an external geojson file. The file comes from csv list of current daily fires from this location: <http://activefiremaps.fs.fed.us/lg_fire2.php#>. Still working on a converter for the csv to json.
